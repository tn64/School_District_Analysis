# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
In the scenario for this module, after reviewing the original analysis, the school board has become concerned that the analysis shows possilbe evidence of academic dishonesty. They are concerned, in particular with the math and reading grades for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School. It appears that these grades have been altered. Because of the need to maintain state educational testing standards (and while not knowing how widespread the academic dishonesty may be), we have been asked  to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs (while making no changes to the other data). After these scores have been replaced, we were to repeat the school district analysis and to  report how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
