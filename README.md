# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
In the scenario for this module, after reviewing the original analysis, the school board has become concerned that the analysis shows possilbe evidence of academic dishonesty. They are concerned, in particular, with the math and reading scores for the ninth-grade students at Thomas High School. It appears that these grades have been altered. Because of the need to maintain state educational testing standards (and while not knowing how widespread the academic dishonesty may be), we have been asked  to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs (while making no changes to the other data). After these scores have been replaced, we were to repeat the school district analysis and to  report how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results 

- How is the district summary affected?

The analysis demonstrated that removing the-ninth grade scores from Thomas High School resulted in a reduction in each math and reading category.

- How does replacing the ninth-graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

After removing Thomas High School's ninth-grade math and reading scores, the high school's performance relative to the other schools showed a marked decrease.

- How does removing the ninth-grade affect math and reading scores by grade? 

Removing the ningh-grade math and reading scores shows no change in the math or reading scores for tenth throuth twelfth-grade.

- How does the new analysis affect scores by school spending

Once again, after removing the ninth-graders at Thomas High School, we see a drop in academic performance.

- How does the new analysis affect scores by school size

Removing the grades from Thomas High School shows a drop in performance for medium-size schools (one of which is Thomas High School).

- How does the new analysis affect scores by school type

The new analysis shows an increase in academic performance by school type.

## Summary 

Four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

1. Academic performance was declined at Thomas High School.
2. Academic performance was reduced at Thomas High School relative to the other high schools.
3. Academic performance declined relative to school spending.
4. Academic performance by school type showed an improvement in the performance of charter schools.
